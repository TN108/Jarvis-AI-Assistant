# Jarvis-AI-Assistant
"Jarvis" is a personal AI virtual assistant designed to handle general tasks similar to Alexa or Google Assistant. Built with Python and utilizing OpenAI's GPT-3.5, this assistant can process natural language commands, execute actions such as opening websites, playing music, and more. The assistant uses speech recognition for listening to commands and text-to-speech for responding aloud, providing an interactive user experience.

Key features include:

Speech recognition to capture commands.

Text-to-speech for verbal responses.

OpenAI integration to process and generate intelligent responses.

Capability to interact with various online services like Google, YouTube, Facebook, etc.

This project showcases my skills in Python programming, AI integration, and working with APIs to build intelligent systems.
